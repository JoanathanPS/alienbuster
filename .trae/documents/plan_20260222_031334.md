I have verified that the necessary code for the **Dataset Ingestion** feature is already implemented in the filesystem from previous steps:

1. **Backend Dependencies**: `requests` is in `backend/requirements.txt`.
2. **Database**: `backend/db.py` includes the `inat_id` column and deduplication logic.
3. **iNat Client**: `backend/inat_client.py` is fully implemented.
4. **Ingestion Routes**: `backend/inat_routes.py` implements the SSE streaming endpoint `/inat/ingest/stream` and calls `recompute_outbreaks`.
5. **Frontend**: `src/pages/Dataset.tsx` is updated to consume the SSE stream and show progress.

**Next Steps (Verification & Delivery):**

1. **Start the Backend**: Launch the FastAPI server to activate the new endpoints.
2. **Verify via CURL**: Run the specific `curl` commands requested to prove the API works:

   * Search Taxon ("Lantana camara")

   * Search Place ("India")

   * Test Ingestion Stream (Dry run or small batch)

   * Check Outbreaks
3. **Final Report**: Output the changed file tree, run commands, and test results as requested.
